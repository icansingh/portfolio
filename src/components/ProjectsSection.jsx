        longDescription: "This Marvel-themed chatbot uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline connected to a vector store containing scripts from 19 Marvel movies (sourced from Kaggle). Powered by a local LLaMA model via Ollama, it can answer detailed, contextual questions about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It also features a character mode, allowing users to receive responses styled after Jarvis, Captain America, Hulk, or Black Panther. The backend was developed using Python and FastAPI, exposed via ngrok, with a React frontend deployed on Vercel.",
