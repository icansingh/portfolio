        longDescription: "This Marvel-themed chatbot uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline connected to a vector store containing scripts from 19 Marvel movies (sourced from Kaggle). Powered by a local LLaMA model via Ollama, it can answer detailed, contextual questions about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It also features a character mode, allowing users to receive responses styled after Jarvis, Captain America, Hulk, or Black Panther. The backend was developed using Python and FastAPI, exposed via ngrok, with a React frontend deployed on Vercel.",

It identifies all players on the field, marks them with circular overlays, highlights the player in possession with a pointer, and tracks the ball itself. The system also computes dynamic match statistics, including player positions, speeds, and possession metrics.",

        longDescription: "Mind Pilot is a human-computer interface developed for Nathacks, a neurotech-focused hackathon. The system combines real-time reinforcement learning with facial and EEG signal processing to allow users to control a computer using only their nose and eyebrow movements. Using the Hecatron library, we trained an agent to recognize EEG patterns (such as an eyebrow raise) as a mouse click. The model trains in minutes, enabling users to customize which EEG signals correspond to specific actions. OpenCV was used to track the nose as a mouse pointer.",

Built in Unity using C#, it was a collaborative team effort where I led the audio design and implementation. I created, edited, and integrated all in-game sound effects and background music using Audacity and Logic Pro. I also contributed to the development of core gameplay mechanics. Our game received an award for Best Audio Design, standing out among all games in the course.",
